---The groupâ€™s timeline for the project is as follows---

Begin work on the assignment November 17th
    meeting with team members to determine the challenges of the project,
    creating the files as specified in the pdf,
    discerning the intended functions of the provided programs by reading through the programming,
    and establishing the challenges that must be overcome.
    Once this has been done, team members will decide what tasks must be done and assign them
    based on individual preferences and familiarity with the functions, splitting them up as appropriate.

The team will meet again on November 22nd
    to determine what progress has been made on the assignments provided
    and to address any concerns that may be had regarding the progress made.
    Work can continue over the then-upcoming Thanksgiving break if necessary,
    but this will be discussed given the nature of the holiday likely requiring travel.

The team will meet again November 29th
    to further verify progress, and determine what additional days they should meet on to complete the project.
    By this point, ideally the programming portion of the project will have been completed,
    with the writeup remaining to be completed.

On December 1st,
    the team will meet once again to work on the writeup for the lab,
    providing their observations and experiences with the lab,
    and taking information from the coding as necessary to further support their analysis.
    This work will preferably be concluded December 1st,
    but may run into December 2nd depending on the progress made.

December 2nd is the due date for the project,
    and as such, all work must be turned in no later than this date.

Updated due date for lab, December 9th,
    and as such, all work must be turned in no later than this date.
